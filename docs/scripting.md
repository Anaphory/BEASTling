# Scripting BEASTling

It is possible, though currently a little awkward, to use BEASTling as a Python library so that you can generate XML files from scripts, without creating a config file first.  This is especially useful for generating  large number of XML files where only one or two options differ across the files.

Documentation coming soon.
