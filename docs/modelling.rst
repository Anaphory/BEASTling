Modelling details
=================

It is important to understand the modelling assumptions made by BEASTling which underly all analyses generated by it.  Substitution models in particular are discussed separately in the next section.

Tree prior
----------

BEASTling defaults to using a `Yule pure-birth prior <https://beast-mcmc.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/Yule.pdf>`_ for phylogenetic trees.  The birthrate is fixed everywhere on the tree, and is estimated during the analysis.  The prior over birthrates is a uniform prior from zero to infinity.  This model is not particularly suitable for linguistic analyses, but it is arguably the simplest tree prior in BEAST which is not totally inappropriate.

A slightly more complicated but more appropriate tree prior is the BirthDeath prior, which can be specified in place of the Yule.

Branch lengths
--------------

If no calibration points have been provided in the configuration, then the trees logged from a BEASTling analysis will have units of "expected number of mutations for a feature with rate 1.0".

If calibration points have been provided, then branch lengths will be in the same units as the calibrations.

Clocks
------

BEASTling supports three different clock models.  These are: strict clocks, where the mutation rate of any particular feature is the same at all points across the tree; relaxed clocks, where the mutation rate of every branch on the tree is tree is sampled individually; and random local clocks, which can be thought of as an interpolation between these two extremes.
